Cultural Linguistic  
Language is primarily a cultural or social product and must be understood as such… It is peculiarly important that linguists, 
who are often accused, and accused justly, of failure to look beyond the pretty patterns of their subject matter, 
should become aware of what their science may mean for the interpretation of human conduct in general. (Sapir 1929: 214)

語言主要是一種文化或社會產物，必須以此方式來理解……特別重要的是，語言學家經常被指責（且這種指責並非毫無道理）
只關注其學科內部精美的結構模式，而忽視更廣泛的層面，因此他們應該意識到語言學對於解釋人類行為可能具有的意義。 

 

Comment: Logos incarnates to different culture. Thus incarnation of the Son is one of the major themes in theology of language.
